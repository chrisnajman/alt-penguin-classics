# Alt-Penguin Classics

## About

Who wouldn't love a job where finding evocative cover images for classic texts is part of the work? Unfortunately, I have no such job, but here are my unpaid efforts. I'll be adding more covers as and when inspiration strikes.

Note: These covers were made using the [Penguin Classics Cover Generator](https://penguin.jos.ht/) .
